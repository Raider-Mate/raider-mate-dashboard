# Changelog

Notable changes to raider-mate-dashboard. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) without a `v` prefix.

The release workflow reads the section matching the pushed tag and uses it as the
GitHub Release body. A tag with no section here fails the release before anything is
published.

Sections are `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **The roster shows enchants, tier pieces, and boss progression.** Three columns, all
  read straight from what the service now returns. Enchants read as "7/8", warm when a
  slot is bare. Tier is the equipped piece count. Progression is all three difficulties
  side by side rather than whichever one looks best, because which kill counts is a raid
  lead's judgement.

  A character the service has established nothing for shows a dash, never a zero. That
  distinction is real: a raider wearing no tier and a service with no season configured
  are different facts, and the service is careful to send them differently.

- **Raid nights on the calendar show how many are confirmed.** Needs the
  `signup_counts` the service now sends on event reads.

- **A calendar under the upcoming events list.** The table answers "what is next"; the
  calendar answers "which nights are we raiding this month", which is the question a raid
  lead asks when booking around one. Arrows step through months, days are placed in the
  guild's own timezone, and each raid links straight to its event page. It needs no extra
  request: the service already returns every upcoming event in one call, so this is a
  second view of a list the page had. Signup counts are not on it yet, because the service
  does not report them per event.

### Changed

- **Pages are wider.** The content column ran to 76rem regardless of screen size, which
  left the roster and comp tables cramped on a desktop monitor while the space beside
  them sat empty. It now runs to 86rem. The top bar and footer follow the same measure,
  so nothing drifts out of line with the content under it.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- **A raider who signs up after the comp is locked is no longer missing from it.** The
  comp panel is drawn from the board, and the board is the snapshot the last lock took,
  so anyone who signed up afterwards was in the signups table and nowhere on the comp,
  with nothing saying the two disagreed. They now sit under the bench in a "Not on the
  board" group, each with the service's reason, and a line saying whether a rebuild
  would seat them or whether the board is hand-built and staying as it is. Characters
  with no roles set turn up there too, since the assigner cannot place them at all.

- **The advisories panel on a comp is no longer always empty.** The service worked its
  advisories out during a lock and never stored them, so the comp this page reads back
  answered with none and the panel had nothing to draw, on every comp, always. They now
  arrive on every read, hand-built comps included: how the raid lead's own template
  departs from the suggestion, and every role the board leaves short. Information before
  pulling, as it always was, and never a reason a save is refused.
- **An advisory no longer names its role twice.** The role is the colour of the dot; the
  message already opens with it.
- **A signup filed after the deadline can now actually be answered.** Signing up once
  signups have closed files a request for a raid lead, and Discord tells them it is
  waiting in the dashboard. The dashboard listed it and offered no way to answer it, so
  the request sat pending and the raider never made it onto the sheet. Pending requests
  now carry Approve and Reject. Approving writes the signup the raider asked for and
  redraws the message in Discord; rejecting closes the request and changes nothing. Both
  appear only on a request still waiting, and only for a raid lead, so two raid leads
  working the same queue get told the other one answered first rather than a failure.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-22

### Changed

- **Container images now publish under `ghcr.io/raider-mate/raider-mate-dashboard`**,
  following the move of the repository to the Raider Mate organisation. Older tags stay
  where they are, under `ghcr.io/phage-solutions/raider-mate-dashboard`; update your
  compose file or pull command before the next upgrade.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- **Search and recent servers on the guild picker.** A raider in dozens of Discord
  servers no longer has to scroll the pile: the picker filters by name as you type, and
  the servers you have opened before sit at the top. Both appear only once there are
  enough servers to be worth it.

- **Analysis.** A new page in the nav, covering the last ninety days: the shape of the
  raid week, who turned up, what you actually field, how much of the roster is still
  showing up, and the roster's item level over time. Attendance is free for every guild.
  The other four panels are part of Premium, and render as locked panels naming what they
  would show rather than as a blurred chart of numbers nobody measured.
- **Gear over time reads the middle half of the raid.** The service now reports quartiles
  over registered mains, so the curve is no longer set by whichever alt somebody
  abandoned at level twenty. The panel says the gap in a sentence: half the raid sits
  between two numbers, over so many mains.
- **Locked panels.** A gated panel now has a shape: full contrast, a neutral Premium
  chip, one sentence, one button. Nothing is blurred or greyed, because a raid lead has
  to be able to read what they would be getting. Whether a panel is locked is the
  service's answer and never a check made here, so a subscription that lapses simply
  stops filling the panels in.
- **The attendance table sorts.** Raider, turnout, no shows and never answered are
  clickable column headers. Server-rendered from the query string, so a sorted view is a
  link you can paste into Discord, it works without script, and the keyboard reaches it
  like any other link. The default is still the order the service sent.
- **The raid week counts raiders, not signups.** A bar covers a week, and a week holds
  however many raids the guild ran, so summing each raid's signups reported more people
  than the guild has: twelve raiders over three nights read as thirty-six. Each bar is
  now how many people confirmed that week, counted once each, and the panel says how many
  raids those bars cover.
- **Hover either chart for the numbers.** A raid week bar gives confirmed, did not
  appear, and how many raids that week held; a gear week gives the median, the middle
  half, and how many mains it was measured over. Keyboard reachable, no script: the
  reveal is hover and focus in CSS.
- **The page opens on something you can read.** Panels the service sent no data for are
  gathered at the end rather than sitting in the middle of the ones that have numbers, so
  a guild without a subscription no longer opens Analysis on an advert. Panels arrive back
  in their proper places the moment the data does.
- **Both charts carry both axes.** Signups per week and item level per week now have a
  labelled y-axis with gridlines, and an x-axis that covers the whole ninety days rather
  than only the weeks with data. A guild two weeks in sees two weeks against a
  thirteen-week grid, which is what having two weeks of history looks like.
- **The first charts in the dashboard.** Hand-drawn SVG, no chart library. Colour on them
  follows the same rule as everywhere else on this surface: a hue means a role or a
  state, and the one chart with no such channel to borrow, item level over time, is drawn
  entirely in neutrals.

Needs raider-mate-service with the analysis endpoints. Against an older service the page
finds no index and shows that it could not ask.

### Fixed

- **The guild picker never told you which servers run Raider Mate.** It groups the ones
  Raider Mate already knows you in above the rest, but the call it makes to find that out
  was answered 400 every time, so everybody saw one flat pile of every Discord server they
  are in. Needs raider-mate-service with the matching fix; against an older service the
  picker degrades to the flat list as before, and now says so in the server log instead of
  passing it off as a working page.
- **The navigation offered pages you could not open yet.** Before a guild is chosen, every
  entry in the bar led somewhere guild-scoped that bounced straight back to the picker.
  The bar now carries your name and the way out, and nothing else, until you have picked
  one.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- **An event can be edited from its own page.** A raid lead opening an event now gets an
  Edit panel: title, difficulty, both times, the reminder lead, and the comp sizes. Before
  this, a raid moved by an hour meant deleting the event and rebuilding it, which threw
  away every signup on it. Saving redraws the signup sheet in Discord, so raiders reading
  the channel see the change without being told twice.

  The type of an event stays what it was. A raid does not become a Mythic+ group, and the
  service will not take the change.

  The redraw needs the raider-mate-service release that queues one for an event edit.
  Against an older service the edit itself still works and the message goes stale.

- **Signups show item level.** The number a raid lead reads when deciding who sits was on
  the roster page and in the comp builder but not on the event, which is where the
  decision is made. A character the roster sync has not reached yet shows a dash rather
  than a zero.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-08-20

### Changed

- **The landing page said hosting was the paid part. It is not.** The plans were one free
  self-hosted column beside one priced hosted column, which reads as "free only if you run
  it yourself". Running Raider Mate on our instance is free: the bot, the signups, the
  roster sync and the comp board, with no card. Premium is the analysis on top of that,
  and only that. The page now shows all three, and says out loud that Premium is not open
  for business yet, which is what the terms have said all along.

### Added

- **Anyone can open a comp and look at it.** The board, the formation and the assigner's
  advisories were previously a raid lead's view of a manual comp and nobody else's:
  everyone else was bounced back to the event. Now the comp opens for any raider who can
  see the event, read-only, with nothing to drag and no save. An auto comp opens the same
  way, so a raid lead can see the assigner's board before deciding to take manual control
  of it.

  The **Edit comp** button on the event page reads **View comp** when the board is not
  yours to move.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **The comp builder did nothing until the page was reloaded.** Opening it from an event
  left the board inert: no beams, no dragging, no saving. Navigating inside the dashboard
  swaps the page without reloading it, and the builder only started itself once per
  reload, so it never started at all on the way in from an event.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- **Comp builder.** A raid lead can hand-edit a comp from the dashboard: drag raiders
  between the tank, healer, melee, ranged and bench columns, and save the board. This is
  the one thing the bot cannot do.

  A comp belongs either to the assigner or to you, never to both. The event page now
  carries the controls for that: **Rebuild from signups** re-runs the assigner over an
  auto comp, **Take manual control** hands you its board to edit, and **Hand back to the
  assigner** reverses it. Converting leaves the slots alone, so the usual path is
  rebuild, take control, then adjust what the assigner came up with.

  Nothing in the builder argues with you. A healer placed as a tank, a raider who never
  signed up, ten people for a twenty-man raid: all saved exactly as arranged. Advisories
  from the assigner are still shown, and still never block a save.

- The comp builder works without a mouse. Enter picks a raider up, the arrow keys move
  them between and within columns, Enter puts them down, and Escape puts them back where
  they started. Every move is announced to a screen reader.

- **A comp can still be edited after the raid has started**, for the swap that happens
  two minutes before pull. The builder says the raid has started and then stays out of
  the way.

- The encounter marker on the comp builder occasionally has something to say. Fifteen
  seconds, once a minute, and it stops entirely while the tab is in the background.
  Unattributed, because you either know it or you do not.

- **A comp can be renamed** from the builder, under Rename. The board comes with it, so
  changing what a group is called costs nothing. A name another comp on the event
  already uses is refused with a plain sentence.

  Needs raider-mate-service 0.8.0 or newer. Against an older service the control does
  not appear, because the service does not offer the link it is rendered from.

### Changed

- A locked manual comp no longer repeats "placed by a raid lead" under every single
  name. The Manual badge on the panel already says it once.

### Fixed

- **A comp edited here now reaches Discord.** Saving a board, locking one, renaming one
  or converting one left the event message in the channel showing the previous comp.
  The fix is in raider-mate-service, which queues the redraw; this repo needed no change
  beyond pointing at a version that has it.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-20

### Changed

- Changed roster visibility

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-20

### Changed

- Your own characters sit at the top of an event's signups table, marked, above the rest
  of the roster. Everyone still reads the whole roster; the row you can actually answer
  for is just no longer somewhere down a column of thirty.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **Every form in the dashboard is refused as a cross-site request once it is deployed
  behind a proxy that terminates TLS.** Signing out, picking a guild, signing up,
  registering a character, saving the configuration and creating an event all answered
  403 with "Cross-site POST form submissions are forbidden".

  Astro rebuilds the request URL from the forwarded headers and compares its origin to
  the browser's `Origin` on every POST. It trusts no forwarded header unless the allowed
  domains are configured, so it fell back to `http://localhost:4321`, which matches
  nothing a real browser sends. Caddy now states the public scheme and host, and the
  build accepts them. Set `PUBLIC_SCHEME=http` for a deployment that is genuinely served
  over plain HTTP; the default is `https`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-20

### Changed
- The comp leads the event page, above the signups. It is what a raid lead opens the page
  for. Before it is locked it is one line rather than an empty panel, so an event nobody
  has locked yet no longer pushes its signups most of a screen down.

### Added

- **Events can be created here, not only with `/raid create` and `/dungeon create`.**
  A raid lead gets a New event button in the top bar, on every page, and the form asks
  for what the slash commands ask for: type, title, difficulty, the two times, the comp
  sizes, and the reminder lead. Raider Mate posts the signup sheet in the guild's events
  channel exactly as the bot does, so answers still come from Discord.

  Times are typed as wall clock and read in the guild's timezone, so 20:00 means the
  20:00 the guild raids at wherever the raid lead happens to be sitting. A guild that has
  set no timezone is told, on the form, that its times are being read as UTC.

  A guild with no events channel set is told so instead of being offered the form: unlike
  a slash command there is no "here" to post in, and an event nobody can see is worse
  than no event.

  Needs the raider-mate-service and raider-mate-discord-bot releases that carry the
  announcement between them.
- Every empty screen inside the dashboard now carries the bot's install button. Signing
  in works whether or not Raider Mate is in your Discord server, so somebody could get
  this far, find four blank pages, and have nothing to click. The events list only offers
  it for upcoming raids: an empty Past list is a guild that has not raided yet, not a
  guild missing the bot.
- A container image that runs the whole dashboard: Caddy on port 8080 in front of the
  node process on loopback, both inside it, as a non-root user. Scaleway's Serverless
  Containers run one container on one port and terminate TLS at the edge, so Caddy's
  automatic HTTPS is off and it never sees the public hostname. If either half dies the
  container exits, so the platform replaces a broken one rather than leaving it serving
  502s from the half still alive.
- CI on every push and pull request: check, build, lint, tests, and a Docker build, plus
  a sign-off check on pull requests. Tagging a release publishes the image to
  `ghcr.io/phage-solutions/raider-mate-dashboard` and cuts a GitHub Release from this file,
  and refuses to do either if the tag has no section here.
- The dashboard itself: an Astro 7 application, server-rendered, running behind Caddy
  in the container described by `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.
- Discord sign-in. The dashboard asks for `identify`, `guilds` and
  `guilds.members.read`, then holds the session in an encrypted cookie rather than any
  server-side store. Signing out and rotating `SESSION_SECRET` both end sessions;
  rotating the secret ends all of them at once.
- A guild picker. Every Discord server you are in is listed, because the service has no
  way yet to say which of them are running Raider Mate. Picking one that is not simply
  shows an empty dashboard.
- A typed client for the raider-mate-service API that reads `_links` and
  `allowed_statuses`, so later screens render the controls the service offered and
  nothing else.
- An overview page showing the next few events, with the full list behind it.
- A roster view: every character registered in the guild, with class and spec, item
  level and Mythic+ score. A character the sync has not reached yet says so, rather
  than showing an empty item level that reads as a missing character.
- An event view: who signed up and as what, the locked comp with its bench and the
  assigner's reason for each slot, and any advisories the assigner raised. Raid leads
  also see the late requests waiting on them.
- Setting your signup status from the event view, and withdrawing. You get the statuses
  the service says you may set and no others, so a raid lead sees NO_SHOW and a raider
  does not. Once signups have closed, the same buttons file a late request instead, and
  the page says so rather than looking like the change went through.
- Raid times shown in the guild's timezone, the one set in guild settings, so everyone
  reads the clock time the raid lead announced. A guild that has not set one still sees
  what the service sent.
- Navigation across the top of every page rather than down the side, so the roster and
  the comp get the full width of the screen.
- Pagination on the events list, ten to a page, with the range and total in view.
- Class colours on the roster and on signup lists, the ones you already read in a raid
  frame, as a marker beside each name.
- How long is left to sign up, in plain words, next to the exact deadline.
- Page transitions. Opening an event carries its row into the page header instead of
  swapping the screen, so you keep your place in a long list. Browsers without the View
  Transitions API navigate normally, and the whole effect is off when the operating
  system asks for reduced motion.
- A landing page at `/`, the one page reachable without signing in. It builds a raid
  comp in front of you as you read it: an empty board fills with signups, the assigner
  fills the slots, the comp flips to manual and two raiders change places, and a bench
  forms. Browsers without scroll-driven animations get the finished board and the same
  argument. Every name on it is invented and the page says so.
- The landing page names the Raider Mate bot and leads with its install. Adding the bot
  is where a guild actually starts, since nothing reaches the dashboard until it is
  posting events in a channel, so that is the page's primary action and signing in sits
  quietly beside it for the guilds already running it.
- Source links to all three repositories, with GitHub's mark on them.
- A privacy policy at `/privacy` and terms of service at `/terms`, both public and
  linked from the footer. The privacy policy is written from what the code actually
  collects, category by category: the three Discord scopes the sign-in asks for, the
  columns the service stores, the Raider.IO lookups, and the one strictly necessary
  session cookie, which is why there is no cookie banner. Guild data is deleted within
  30 days of the bot being removed, and a raider can have their own erased without their
  guild leaving.
- Pricing on the landing page: free and self-hostable under the AGPL, or hosted Premium
  at 2.99 EUR a month or 29.99 EUR a year, VAT included, through Stripe.
- Server icons in the guild picker.
- Past events. The events page has an Upcoming and a Past view, both paginated, and a
  raid that has started moves from one to the other.
- Linking a WarcraftLogs report to an event. Raid leads get a field on the event page to
  paste the report URL into, and everyone else sees the link once it is there. The
  service decides what counts as a report link and what a raid lead may attach, so a
  raider never sees a control that would be refused.
- The Raider Mate mark, the same one the bot posts under in Discord, in the top bar, on
  the sign-in page, and as the browser tab icon.

### Changed

- Raid-lead actions now follow the guild's mapped roles alone. A Discord server admin
  who holds none of them can configure the guild but cannot create or edit events, which
  matches how guilds actually split those two jobs. This needs raider-mate-service 0.6.0
  or later.
- The dashboard overview moved from `/` to `/dashboard`, because `/` is now the public
  landing page. Signing in, picking a guild, and the Overview link all lead to the new
  address, and a signed-in visitor asking for `/` is sent to it.
- Signing out lands on the landing page rather than a separate login screen.

### Removed

- The separate `/login` page. It held a heading, a sentence and one Discord button, all
  of which the landing page already carries, and it meant signing out dropped you on the
  emptiest page on the site. Sign-in problems are reported on the landing page now.

- Your main leads the "My characters" page, carrying the accent border, with the alts
  under their own heading beneath it. A raider with six alts should not have to hunt for
  the one a raid lead plans around.
- Headings that follow a card get proper space above them again. A section only took its
  margin from another section, so a heading after a panel sat welded to it.
- A "My characters" page. Every member can register a character, say which roles it can
  play, move their main, and remove one. Removing a character takes its signups, comp
  slots and gear history with it, which is the self-service erasure the privacy policy
  points at. Registering and editing characters used to be possible only through the
  bot.
- The guild's highest Discord role is locked on in the raid-leads picker and cannot be
  unticked, because the service now refuses any mapping that leaves it out. Unticking
  everything used to leave a guild unable to create an event with nothing on screen
  saying why. Needs raider-mate-service 0.6.0 or later.
- Configuration is open to raid leads as well as Discord admins, and the nav entry
  appears only for them. Whether you may configure the guild is the service's answer,
  cached on the session and re-asked on the same clock as your Discord roles, so losing
  a raid-lead role removes the page within a refresh interval. Against a service too old
  to answer, the page falls back to the Discord admins who had it before, so upgrading
  the two repos in either order never leaves nobody able to configure a guild.
- A guild configuration page for raid leads and Discord server admins. It maps which Discord roles
  count as raid leads, and sets the events channel, the guild timezone, the reminder
  lead and delivery, and which roles a new event mentions. Mapping raid-lead roles used
  to be possible only through the bot.
- The guild picker asks Raider Mate which servers it already knows you in and leads with
  those, instead of making you find yours among every Discord server you have ever
  joined. When exactly one of them is running Raider Mate and you have not chosen yet,
  it is picked for you. If the service cannot answer, the full list is still there.

### Fixed

- The Configuration entry no longer disappears because the service was briefly
  unreachable. Whether you may configure a guild was resolved once when you picked it,
  and a failed lookup was cached as "no" for the next fifteen minutes, which locked
  raid leads out of a page they could still open by typing its address. Not knowing is
  now kept distinct from being told no, and an unresolved answer is retried on the next
  request instead of waiting out the refresh interval.
- Signing in again is required once: the session payload changed shape, so its version
  was bumped rather than letting older cookies read the new field as absent.

### Security

- The shared service API key stays on the server. It is declared as an `astro:env`
  secret, which fails the build rather than the deploy if anything client-side ever
  imports it.
- Sign-out is a `POST`. A sign-out reachable by `GET` can be fired by any image tag on
  any page. Form posts from another site are refused, since Astro checks the `Origin`
  header and the session cookie is `SameSite=Lax`.
